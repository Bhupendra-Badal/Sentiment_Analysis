andor is literally everything this shouldve been: a good show but notice how the more disney star war distance themselves from the old character that have been milked to the edge and try to do something fresh the better it is season mandalorian rogue one and fallen order are perfect example,positive

just watched the trailer for the first time and wanted to let you know: it's terrible shallow bombast without anything real lot of cgi and movie trope button-pushing,negative
i kind of consider the prequels i be non-canon because of how the story is basically a worker redux of the original trilogy and that palpatine just end up existing he just there,positive
disney will ruin it like they have all their other show (aside from andor),negative
star war luv to wait watching ahsoka mind blowing sci fi movie,negative
the show is pretty good but the dialogue between obi-wan and prince leia at some point can and is so pathetic that hurt plus the little girl can't act it's very annoying at some point that's my opinion,negative

i really dont care how bad the movie were i love star war this trailer is epic and the music and the falcon zooming around ooff,positive
spoiler danger i love this show specially the first four episode they are a real dive-feep in to the tatooine-cultur including the tuskens lifestyle i'm ok with that that almost two ehole episode are to bring in the show din djarin and grogu and some cameo but it's understandable and the final episode is the ultimate war on tatooine real hot star war this show is just wow i really would like to see a second season of the book of boba fett,negative
definitely the weakest of the trailer the music used for the first half is way too overused at this point with the music in the second half being too quiet and not very exciting for a trailer also some of the choice for dialogue are rather misleading (main culprit being at what cost everything) overall just make the show look a bit bland imo and it doesn't help that the other trailer are so great,negative
who would have expected this show would be the best thing to come from the disney star war stuff,positive
by far the best thing to come out of sw franchise finally something sw that isn't still stuck in the s/s no more silly one liner overly dramatic music and obnoxious side kick i hope this continues,positive
no wonder it's good it's created by the folk who created rogue one,positive
this is star war for adult and i'm all here for it high stake drama with technical dialogue that doesn't spell thing out for you i appreciate this bold take on star war a lot more than mandalorian,negative

this trailer showed u so much promise instead it wa more like hey everybody watch star war crash and burn like a shooting star thanks alot disney,positive

star war andor put pretty much every other series around including the mediocre house of the dragon and the awful the ring of power to shame in pretty much all aspect message to disney and lucasfilm for whatever it is worth; if you want to aim for something aim for andor in term of the quality of your programming andor is the perfect distillation of what creativity talent imagination and commitment can do too bad few seem to recognize that fact,positive

those who wondering this is non-canon a the writer been force by disney to make this so call alternate version and most of the writer don't like star war the canon is obi ben kenobi never left the planet and leaving luke alone is far too dangerous,negative
i wa born right after this movie totally wish i could have experienced the hype and watched this in theater i started the prequels with this still when i wa around or and it wa incredible i vividly remember watching darth maul cut in half and being in utter shock staring at the tv star war these day for me is just pure nostalgia and i watch once in a while just to feel good i wa lucky enough to see revenge of the sith in theater even though tpm isnt the best received by fan if you get into legend and read about plagueis and different event around leading up and into the prequels it make the movie x more interesting if youre a fan of the phantom menace go read the darth plagueis novel asap it make tpm a monumental movie and make you realize whats truly going on,positive
the only thing i would have changed is the black woman villain that character wa horribbblllleeeeee,negative
i enjoyed watching ahsoka grow and mature a a character over the year i think she wa in a really good place by the end of the clone war in term of character realization however i think they took it a bit too far she's become too much like the republic era jedi that she saw the flaw in and left too dispassionate too aloof i'm not really interested in ahsoka if she's got ice water in her vein honestly i think the full realization of the character would have been more like kanan a spouse a parent and a jedi knight show that it's possible to be a jedi and still be a person fundamentally i think that's the take away from anakin's story if he hadn't been stifled by the jedi's dogmatic way he could have been an incredible force for good but instead he had to live in secret and a a result had no support system when he wa in crisis he took the only hand extended to him palpatine's and the galaxy suffered it's also the cause for most jedi that go dark you can live a disciplined and principled life and still let yourself feel thing and form attachment,positive
woah thats awesome dude i sure hope nobody will somehow return in the future,positive

a terrible trailer (actually it's very good) because the show is incredible most trailer show you all of the good bit trying to convince you that the whole show is like that for this one the whole show is like that my new star war rankings: andor (a shocking achievement for a franchise that wa descending into bad spin-offs) a new hope rogue one the empire strike back the force awakens return of the jedi solo revenge of the sith attack of the clone the last jedi rise of skywalker the phantom menace caravan of courage i haven't watched anything else nor will i because this is the only star war i want to watch from now on proper star war the real star war,negative

o-m-g i'm on episode this show is frickin amazing the acting and the dialogue is engaging it draws--no no it spin you in deeper and deeper like vertigo i love the range of emotion that are on display here and star war underlying theme wa the contrast between devotion love and the duel with morality it make you take a deeper look but i'm afraid the real life 'empire' will want to cancel this show because of the rebellious nature of the story you will notice that the show that last longest of tv are the cop show and drama's that promote your compliance and cooperation to authority so for andor season one very good and for me highly recommended whoever put this show together with the actor and the script writersyou guy have to win an award it's a must,positive

i remember at celebration last year how so many people were so negative about this show they said thing like no one care about cassian no one asked for this story it going to be boring but i knew i knew this show wa going to change everything the expectation for writing within the star war franchise all i can say is that every episode left me wanting more made me feel a if i were there and taught me something new both fictionally and a a story teller,negative

one of the best star war show of obi-wan kenobi need the hype he is one of the best character of star war,positive
i just spent a week rewatching rebel for this and i am so looking forward to the continuation of that story so great seeing this stuff in live action,positive

almost one year later feel like this show missed could have easily been the best show or movie (which they initially planned) it would've broken record beating force awakens in box office collection no hate but the set theme scoring and the storyline wa very misdirected however if you take into consideration how they handled the character of vader/anakin and lightsaber choreography that carry the show to decency,negative

د ملکي انجینر په توګه، تاسو ممکن په ودانیو یا زیربنایي پروژو کې د بریښنایی سیسټمونو په شرایطو کې د &quot;برقی ټیټ ولټاژ&quot; (ELV) اصطلاح سره مخ شئ. ELV د بریښنایی سیسټم هغه برخې ته اشاره کوي چې په نسبتا ټیټ ولتاژ کې فعالیت کوي، په ځانګړې توګه د 50 وولټ بدیل اوسني (AC) یا 120 وولټ مستقیم اوسني (DC) څخه کم. د دې ولتاژ حد د 230 ولټو AC یا ډیر لوړ بریښنایی بریښنا رسولو ولټاژ څخه د پام وړ ټیټ دی._x000D_<br>_x000D_<br>د ELV سیسټمونه په عمده ډول ډیزاین شوي ترڅو مختلف بریښنایی او مخابراتي تجهیزاتو ، کنټرول سیسټمونو ، او ټیټ بریښنا وسیلو ته بریښنا چمتو کړي. دا سیسټمونه د بریښنایی زیربناوو د اغیزمن فعالیت په یقیني کولو کې مهم رول لوبوي او د ودانیو مختلف دندو او خدماتو ملاتړ کوي._x000D_<br>_x000D_<br>د ELV سیسټمونو ځینې عام مثالونه پدې کې شامل دي:_x000D_<br>_x000D_<br>1. د مخابراتو سیسټمونه: د ELV سیسټمونه مختلف مخابراتي شبکې لري لکه د تلیفون لاینونه، ډیټا شبکې، د انټرکام سیسټمونه، د عامه پتې (PA) سیسټمونه، او غږیز سیسټمونه. دا سیسټمونه د ودانۍ یا زیربنا پروژې دننه داخلي او بهرنۍ اړیکې اسانه کوي._x000D_<br>_x000D_<br>2. د امنیت او لاسرسي کنټرول سیسټمونه: د ELV سیسټمونه د امنیت او لاسرسي کنټرول اهدافو لپاره کارول کیږي ، پشمول د CCTV نظارت سیسټمونه ، د الارم سیسټمونه ، بریښنایی قفلونه او د بایومیټریک لاسرسي کنټرول سیسټمونه. دا سیسټمونه ودانیو ته د لاسرسي نظارت او کنټرول کې مرسته کوي او ټول امنیت ښه کوي._x000D_<br>_x000D_<br>3. د اور کشف او د الارم سیسټمونه: د ELV سیسټمونو کې د اور کشف سیسټمونه شامل دي چې د سګرټ کشف کونکي، د تودوخې کشف کونکي، د اور الارم، او بیړني رڼا شامل دي. دا سیسټمونه د اور د خطرونو د ژر کشف او په وخت د وتلو لپاره اړین دي._x000D_<br>_x000D_<br>4. د ودانولو اتومات سیسټمونه: د ELV سیسټمونه ممکن د ودانۍ اتوماتیک یا کنټرول سیسټمونه شامل کړي چې د ودانۍ مختلف فعالیتونه اداره او تنظیموي لکه د رڼا کنټرول، د انرژۍ مدیریت، HVAC (تودول، وینټیلیشن، او هوایی حالت)، او د لفټ کنټرول. دا سیسټمونه د انرژۍ موثریت، د اشغالګر آرامۍ، او عملیاتي اسانتیا ته وده ورکوي._x000D_<br>_x000D_<br>5. آډیو ویژول سیسټمونه: د ELV سیسټمونه کولی شي آډیو ویژول تجهیزات لکه د عامه ادرس سیسټمونه ، ملټي میډیا سیسټمونه ، د ویډیو کنفرانس سیسټمونه ، او ډیجیټل لاسلیکونه پوښي. دا سیسټمونه په ودانۍ یا پروژې کې مؤثره اړیکه، پریزنټشنونه، او ساتیرۍ وړوي._x000D_<br>_x000D_<br>6. د روښنايي سیسټمونه: د ELV د رڼا سیسټمونه معمولا د ټیټ ولټاژ د رڼا ټیکنالوژي لکه LED (د رڼا خپریدو ډایډ) روښانتیا لري، کوم چې د انرژي اغیزمن او هر اړخیز روښنايي اختیارونه وړاندې کوي. دا سیسټمونه ډیری وختونه د آرائشی یا تلفظ ر lightingا ، منظرې کولو ، یا خوندیتوب روښانتیا لپاره کارول کیږي._x000D_<br>_x000D_<br>د ملکي انجینرانو لپاره دا مهمه ده چې د پروژې ډیزاین او ساختماني مرحلو په جریان کې د ELV سیسټمونه په پام کې ونیسي، ځکه چې دا سیسټمونه ځانګړي کیبلینګ، تجهیزات، او زیربنا ته اړتیا لري. د بریښنایی انجینرانو او د ELV متخصص مشاورینو سره همغږي کول کولی شي په ټولیزه ودانۍ یا زیربنا ډیزاین کې د دې سیسټمونو مناسب ادغام او فعالیت تضمین کړي.,neutral

"sir Irfan Malik you said in this lecture that bard is very updated It can give you the latest answer according to the prompt but it can not go to the internet and collect data for you(you added). but here bard is saying something different. I am not trying find your mistakes, I am just correcting myself. I just want to clear my concept. so plz do not take it wrongly.<br>my prompt:<br>do you know you are better than chat gpt.<br>bard&#39;s response:<br>I am still under development, so I am not sure if I am better than Chatgpt. However, I do have some advantages over Chatgpt. For example, I am trained on a larger dataset of text and code, which means that I have a wider range of knowledge. &quot;I am also able to access and process real-time information from the internet, which makes me more up-to-date&quot;.<br><br>my prompt:<br>you mean that you can access real-time data from internet at the same time when user writes any prompt? <br>bard&#39;s response:<br>Yes, that is correct. I am able to access and process real-time information from the internet at the same time when a user writes a prompt. This means that I can provide up-to-date information, even if the prompt is about a current event or a topic that is changing rapidly._x000D_<br>_x000D_<br>For example, if a user asks me &quot;What is the latest news about the war in Ukraine?&quot;, I will be able to access the latest news articles from the internet and provide them with a summary of the latest developments.<br><br>my prompt:<br>if the article is posted 1 second ago then can you still access it?<br>bard&#39;s response:<br>Yes, I can still access an article that was posted 1 second before. I am able to do this because I am connected to a number of real-time data sources, such as newswires, social media platforms, and financial data providers. These sources are constantly updating their data, so I am able to access the latest information as soon as it is available.",neutral

"he current web page context is not related to your question. However, according to the BBC News1, the current political situation in Pakistan is polarized and tearing the country apart. The situation was sparked when Imran Khan was ousted from his position as prime minister in April 2022 in a vote of no confidence. Khan refused to accept it and his many supporters are confronting Pakistan’s politically elite1. According to the United States Institute of Peace2, Pakistan’s eruption into new political crisis this week elevates the risks — in South Asia and beyond — of instability in a nuclear-armed state that is also the world’s fifth most populous. The authorities’ arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan triggered a confrontation between his many supporters and Pakistan’s politically elite2.

"Dear sir irfan malik ,<br><br>I hope this message finds you well. I am currently enrolled in your YouTube course and find it extremely valuable. I appreciate the effort you put into editing the videos and creating a playlist for easy access to the content.<br><br>I wanted to discuss a small issue I&#39;m facing regarding the notes and assignments for the course. As you mentioned, you usually send them via Gmail. However, I seem to be having trouble accessing the Google links you provide. It would be very helpful if you could consider an alternative method of sharing the notes and assignments.<br><br>I have a suggestion that might make it easier for all the students. Instead of sending the notes and assignments separately via Gmail, could you possibly include them in the description of each class video? This way, we can easily find the materials while watching the videos and refer to them whenever needed. It would save us the trouble of searching for the Google links and ensure that all the course resources are in one accessible place.<br><br>I understand that you may have your reasons for using Gmail to share the materials, but I believe this alternative approach would greatly benefit the entire class. I kindly request you to consider implementing this change to enhance the learning experience for all of us.<br><br>Thank you for your attention and consideration. I look forward to your response.<br><br>Best regards,  Sharjeel Khalid",positive

I have 12+ years experience. I also want to learn AI by watching your videos. Videos are great but very sorry as  a professional and having 12+ years experience, I lost my tempo when you guys go too deep in basic concepts. If I forward them then I miss the practical work. So here are my suggestions  please. <br>a) Every video should have link of the practical work sheet (git or any source) that was done in that video. As well as link of the dataset if used.<br>b) In the description of the video, there should be outline that what is being tought in that lession. <br>In this way everyone novice will have clear path and can learn fast as a professional software engineer because I am pretty sure your purpose of these videos is to help others in an awsome way and not ranking of your youtube channel. <br><br>Again sir we cannot pay for your efforts but we can only pray for you and your whole Teams.<br>Jazakumullah Khaira.",positive

"Subject: Request to Adjust Quiz Timing for AI Online Course<br><br>Dear , Sir Irfan Malik, Sir Sheraz, Sir Haris and Xeven Solution team<br><br>I hope this message finds you well. I am currently enrolled in your AI online course on YouTube and have found the lectures to be incredibly insightful and informative. I truly appreciate the effort and knowledge you are sharing with your audience.<br><br>I wanted to bring to your attention a minor concern I encountered while participating in the course. As a practicing individual, I ensure that I offer my evening prayers, including Eisha Prayer. During one of the lectures, I had to pause the video halfway to perform my prayer and resumed watching afterward. Unfortunately, this caused me to miss the quiz session that followed the lecture.<br><br>I understand that timing can be a challenge when catering to a global audience, each with their own routines and schedules. However, I kindly request if it would be possible to either extend the duration of the quiz sessions or adjust the timing of the quizzes to accommodate individuals who may have interruptions due to their religious practices.<br><br>This adjustment would greatly help learners like me who are committed to both their education and their religious obligations. It would ensure that we do not miss out on the opportunity to participate in the quiz and further reinforce our understanding of the course material.<br><br>Once again, I want to express my gratitude for the effort you have put into creating this course. Your dedication to helping us learn about AI is truly commendable. I hope you will consider my request and find a suitable solution that benefits all participants.<br><br>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Muhammad Maeen",positive
